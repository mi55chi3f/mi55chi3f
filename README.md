Hi! I'm a newbie programmer learning on my own (· ·)/

I'm also a translator who is training to be a proper one, although I have experience with translations!
I have taken baby steps on the game dev world too. I'm open to lend a hand in whichever way I can, so hit me up if a translator is needed!
(or an assistant, I'm very good at organizing)

Nice to meet ya all!☆
